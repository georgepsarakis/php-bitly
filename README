Hello everyone. This is my effort to gradually 
create a PHP wrapper class 
for the great bit.ly service for shortening URLs.
You will need a username and an API key from bitly to test this class, 
which you can easily obtain after registering.
I tried to make it compact but flexible. It allows both formats JSON and XML for the response and has a (minimum) error detection. Keep in mind that the service has rate limiting which resets every hour or so.
You can read the complete documentation here http://code.google.com/p/bitly-api/wiki/ApiDocumentation .
Any feedback will be much appreciated.
